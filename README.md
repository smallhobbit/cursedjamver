# cursedjamver

In a gritty Victorian setting, a curse has befallen many people in the land that can only be broken by true loveâ€™s kiss. Till then, the afflicted are sectioned off in a special hospital ward till they have either been cured or the curse progresses to its permanent state.

Currently. most of the framework is ready (only the inventory system and possibly a locked choice/hint system)
